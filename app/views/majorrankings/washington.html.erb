Computer Science & Engineering was established at the University of Washington as an inter-college graduate program in 1967. In 1975 an undergraduate program in Computer Science was added and departmental status was conferred. A second undergraduate program, in Computer Engineering, was added in 1989 when CSE moved to the College of Engineering, and a Professional Master's Program was added in 1996, and a combined Bachelors/Masters program in 2008. CSE currently has roughly fifty faculty, fifty staff members, 375 graduate students (200 in the full-time program and 175 in the Professional Masters Program), and 600 undergraduate students (200 Bachelors graduates per year).
